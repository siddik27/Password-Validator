# Password-Validator
This is a simple Java console application that checks if a user's password is strong enough. It validates the password based on common rules like minimum length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

I built this project to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. The logic is separated into different classes to keep the code clean and easy to understand. It's a good beginner-friendly project for learning string handling, input validation, and modular coding in Java.
